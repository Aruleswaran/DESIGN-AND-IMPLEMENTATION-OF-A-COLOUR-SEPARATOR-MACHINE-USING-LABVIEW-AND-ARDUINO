# DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-A-COLOUR-SEPARATOR-MACHINE-USING-LABVIEW-AND-ARDUINO
The MyRIO controller receives the images from the webcam, processes them using LabVIEW software, and controls the servo motor to move the separator based on the colour of the object.
Automated sorting: The color separator machine uses machine vision technology to automatically sort colored objects based on their color, reducing the need for manual labor.

Real-time image processing: The machine captures images of the objects in real-time and processes them using LabVIEW software to determine the color of the objects.

Color identification: The machine is capable of accurately identifying the color of objects based on the color ranges defined in the LabVIEW code.

Servo motor control: The Arduino microcontroller controls the servo motor for the sorting mechanism, allowing for accurate and precise sorting of objects.

Multiple bin sorting: The sorting mechanism can sort objects into multiple bins based on their color, providing flexibility and versatility.

Integration with myRIO controller: The machine can be integrated with a myRIO controller for enhanced performance, providing real-time processing capabilities and improving the accuracy and efficiency of the sorting mechanism.

User-friendly interface: The LabVIEW software provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily define color ranges and control the sorting mechanism.

Overall, the Simple Machine Vision Project - Color Separator Machine provides an automated and efficient solution for sorting colored objects, with advanced features such as real-time image processing, color identification, and servo motor control.
